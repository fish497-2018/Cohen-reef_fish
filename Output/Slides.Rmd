```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## FISHES

```{r, out.width= "700px"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/reeffish.jpg")
```

## Load all the packages

```{r, include=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
```

## Read in that data
The data that I chose was from FigShare  [reef_fish](https://figshare.com/articles/RLS_reef_fish_dataset.csv/934320)  
The data is on reef fish in Australia and New Zealand that was taken over a 3 year period. Each entry has a specific latitude and longitude that corresponds with the site and site code which I use to break up the data since it is so large (over 130,000 entries). Each entry is made by a diver who observed the fish families and counted the totals.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
reef_fish <- read.csv('../data/RLSreeffishdataset.csv')
```

## Separate the data by site
* site CG10

```{r, echo=TRUE}
CG10_site <- select(reef_fish, SiteCode, Diver, Family, Total) %>% 
  filter(SiteCode == "CG10")
```
* site CG11

```{r, echo=TRUE}
CG11_site <- select(reef_fish, SiteCode, Diver, Family, Total) %>% 
  filter(SiteCode == "CG11") 
```
  
## Facet wrap by Family
Want to see if there is a difference between what divers see at the sight

```{r}
ggplot(CG10_site, aes(Diver, Total, color = Diver)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap("Family") +
  labs(x = "Diver", y = "Total_Fish_Count", color = "Divers")
```
  
## Plotting the CG10 Site by Diver
```{r}
ggplot(CG10_site, aes(Family, Total, color = Family)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap("Diver") +
  labs(x = "Family", y = "Total_Fish_Count", color = "Family")
```
  
## Facet Plots by family
```{r}
ggplot(CG11_site, aes(Diver, Total, color = Diver)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap("Family") +
  labs(x = "Diver", y = "Total_Fish_Count", color = "Divers")
```
  
## Plotting the CG11 Site by Diver
```{r}
ggplot(CG11_site, aes(Family, Total, color = Family)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap("Diver") +
  labs(x = "Family", y = "Total_Fish_Count", color = "Family")
```

## Average Depth of Common Species
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(new_data2 <- reef_fish %>%
  select(SiteCode, Family, Depth) %>%
  filter(Family == "Scorpididae" | Family == "Pomacentridae" | Family == "Plesiopidae" | Family == "Enoplosidae") %>% 
  group_by(Family, SiteCode) %>%
  summarise(avg_Depth = mean(Depth)) %>%
  spread(SiteCode, avg_Depth) %>% 
  select(CG10, CG11))

```
