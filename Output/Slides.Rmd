```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## FISHES

```{r, out.width= "700px"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/reeffish.jpg")
```

## Load all the packages

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
```

## Read in that data

```{r, echo=TRUE}
reef_fish <- read.csv('../data/RLSreeffishdataset.csv')
```

## Separate the data by site
* site CG10
<small>
```{r, echo=TRUE}
CG10_site <- select(reef_fish, SiteCode, Diver, Family, Total) %>% 
  filter(SiteCode == "CG10")
```
* site CG11
<small>
```{r, echo=TRUE}
CG11_site <- select(reef_fish, SiteCode, Diver, Family, Total) %>% 
  filter(SiteCode == "CG11") 
```
  
## Facet wrap by Family
Want to see if there is a difference between what divers see at the sight

```{r}
ggplot(CG10_site, aes(Diver, Total, color = Diver)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap("Family") +
  labs(x = "Diver", y = "Total_Fish_Count", color = "Divers")
```
  
## Plotting the CG10 Site by Diver
```{r}
ggplot(CG10_site, aes(Family, Total, color = Family)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap("Diver") +
  labs(x = "Family", y = "Total_Fish_Count", color = "Family")
```
  
## Facet Plots by family
```{r}
ggplot(CG11_site, aes(Diver, Total, color = Diver)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap("Family") +
  labs(x = "Diver", y = "Total_Fish_Count", color = "Divers")
```
  
## Plotting the CG11 Site by Diver
```{r}
ggplot(CG11_site, aes(Family, Total, color = Family)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap("Diver") +
  labs(x = "Family", y = "Total_Fish_Count", color = "Family")
```
