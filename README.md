# Cohen-reef_fish

This is our week 8 assignment where we take a data set and use it to show what we have learned in R and how to collaborate on GitHub.

The data that I chose was from FigShare and can be reached at: https://figshare.com/articles/RLS_reef_fish_dataset.csv/934320

The data is on reef fish in Australia and New Zealand that was taken over a 3 year period. Each entry has a specific latitude and longitude that corresponds with the site and site code which I use to break up the data since it is so large (over 130,000 entries). Each entry is made by a diver who observed the fish families and counted the totals. 

Is there Diver bias that can be seen by the total family counts, meaninf does one diver count more fish or count more of one species than others.

--We could plot facet wraps by family of total counts by diver

--See if there is a difference in fish count by site. Using site code CG10 and CG11
