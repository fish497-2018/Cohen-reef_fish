# Cohen-reef_fish

DATA can be reached at: https://figshare.com/articles/RLS_reef_fish_dataset.csv/934320

The data is on reef fish in Australia and New Zealand that was taken over a 3 year period. Each entry has a specific latitude and longitude that corresponds with the site, as well as record  of which divers recorded the counts of each family. 

I am not really sure what to ask, these were my questions that I posted with the quiz as ideas:    

--We could plot facet wraps by family of how many fish are found at depths

--We could see if there is a bias trend by diver

--See if there is a difference in fish count by site
